# Exam-Management-OOP-SOLID-Design-Patterns

This Java-based project implements a modular **Exam Management System** for multiple subjects, each represented as a separate question repository. Users can create exams (manual/automatic), add or remove questions and answers, and persist all data in binary files.

Key features include:
* **Support for open and close questions**
* **Interactive menu interface**
* Use of **Java Collections (ArrayList)** with **Generics** and **Iterators**
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** architecture with encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction
* Clean design following **SOLID principles**
* Integration of key **Design Patterns**:
  * `Factory`, `Facade`, `Singleton`, `Command`, `Observer`, `Adapter`

The system is built for scalability, maintainability, and future extensibility.
